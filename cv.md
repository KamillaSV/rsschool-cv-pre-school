## About myself
I am currently on sabbatical leave. Previously, I worked in the field of HR, but there always was interest in the field of IT, so I decided to use the sabbaticle period with benefit.

I would very much like to work in a large international company, where you could find an application for your English skills, gain experience in working with non-standard interesting tasks, work in a close-knit team of professionals in their field, from whom you can learn a lot.

My personal interests include an active lifestyle, travel, foreign languages, psychology, creativity and self-development.
